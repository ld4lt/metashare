The Metashare Ontology as Created by the LD4LT Community Group (http://www.w3.org/community/ld4lt/)

The ontology supports the representation of metadata from language resources. 

Currently, the "master" branch contains the stable v1 of the ontology and the "dev" branch is a working directory where MetaShare-owl v2 is being developed.
